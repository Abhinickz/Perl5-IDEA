#Perl5 plugin for IntellijIDEA - Camelcade

This is my attempt to build a plugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - you may fork or contact me via skype: hurricup

#Need testers
There is tremendous amount of work to do in development and project really need testers. Not only users-testers, but someone
to write tests (mostly for lexer and parser at the moment).

#Current status - development (0.29 beta)
