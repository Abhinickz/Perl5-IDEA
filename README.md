#Perl5 plugin for IntellijIDEA - Camelcade

This is my attempt to build a plugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - you may fork or contact me via skype: hurricup

#Need testers
There is tremendous amount of work to do in development and project really need testers. Not only users-testers, but someone
to write tests (mostly for lexer and parser at the moment).

#Current status - development (0.24 beta)

* Implemented Perl SDK type, Perl5 module type.
* Implemented support for Perl5, POD and php-style perl <? ... ?>
* Implemented syntax highlighting, basic brace matcher, find usages, livetemplates. 
* Implemented basic code-folding for blocks, hashes, arrays, PODs, heredocs and sequential comments and imports.
* Implemented autocompletion for built-in functions, installed packages, namespaces and variables.
* Implemented autocompletion, navigation and refactoring for lexical variables.
* Implemented autocompletion, navigation and refactoring for global variables.
* Implemented basic project functions auto-completion, navigation and refactoring (works with obvious calls for now: package::method and package->method, auto-complete is pretty stupid)
* Implemented packages navigation and refactoring. For navigation to package files and refactoring, your lib root -I must be added to classroot.
* Implemented subs annotations: #@deprecated, #@returns, #@method and #@override. Annotations helps IDEA to understand your code properly and give you useful hints.
* Implemented warning annotations for variables shadowing previous declarations, undeclared variables, undefined and undeclared subs, not installed packages. 
* Lexer and parser still have some bugs, see issue tracker and don't hesitate to report.
* Current, dev build you may find here: http://evstigneev.com/camelcade.jar
