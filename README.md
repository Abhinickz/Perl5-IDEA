#Perl5 plugin for IntellijIDEA - Camelcade

This is my attempt to build a plugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - you may fork or contact me via skype: hurricup

#Need testers
There is tremendous amount of work to do in development and project really need testers. Not only users-testers, but someone
to write tests (mostly for lexer and parser at the moment).

#Current status - development (0.16 beta)

* Implemented support for php-style perl <? ... ?>
* Implemented syntax highlighting for Perl and POD
* Implemented file types for Perl scripts and packages, POD files, XS files.
* Implemented autocompletion for built-in functions, packages and variables.
* Implemented autocompletion for lexical variables.
* Implemented project functions auto-completion

* Implemented basic code-folding for blocks, hashes, arrays, PODs, heredocs and sequential comments and imports.
* Implemented crude defined subs, used packages and defined variables autocompletion.
* Implemented basic brace matcher
