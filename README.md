#Perl5 plugin for IntellijIDEA - Camelcade

This is my attempt to build a plugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - you may fork or contact me via skype: hurricup

#Current status - beta testing and develpment

* Implemented JFlex lexer and Grammar-kit for Perl and POD. They still have some bugs, see issue tracker.
* Implemented support for php-style perl <? ... ?>
* Implemented syntax highlighting for Perl and POD
* Implemented file types for Perl scripts and packages, POD files, XS files.
* Implemented autocompletion for built-in functions, packages and variables.
* Implemented basic code-folding for blocks, hashes, arrays, PODs and heredocs.
* Implemented crude defined subs, used packages and defined variables autocompletion.
* Current, let's say, stable version, you may find in the camelcade.jar (ready for installation)
