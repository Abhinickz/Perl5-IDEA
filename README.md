#Perl5 plugin for IntellijIDEA

This is my attempt to build aplugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

I used Groovy IDEA plugin as an example. 

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - welcome.

Simultaneously i've created same plugn for Perl6 and i'll try to keep both plugins up to date.
